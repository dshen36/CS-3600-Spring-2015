For both penDataSet and carDataSet, test accuracy is lowest when there is no hidden layer, and then it grows dramatically when number of neurons in the hidden layer increases from 0 to 5. After a while, however, test accuracy does not grow as number of neurons increases. For penData, test accuracy reaches its peak at n = 15, and then there is a slight drop, but as n passes 25 the test accuracy becomes stable at around 0.90. For carData, test accuracy reaches its highest point at n = 5, and then there is a slight drop with some turbulance when n is between 15 and 20. After that, the test accuracy stabilized at approximately 0.85.
