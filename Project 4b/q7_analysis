Initially, when there is no hidden layer, the average accuracy was 0.4; however, as the number of neurons in the hidden layer grows, the average accuracy grows as well, and when there are 48 neurons average accuracy reached 1.0. This result basically matches what I expected, because more neurons will result in more connections and when the neuronetwork is backpropogating the delta changes with repect of the last layer will be adjusted more accurately.
